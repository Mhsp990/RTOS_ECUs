# RTOS_ECUs
Arduino with trampoline (RTOS) for simulating 3 car ECU ( ECM, ICM, TCM).
In each folder there is one source code (both the trampoline + arduino code). 
For the system to work, you must set up a circuit with 3 arduinos. Each one must have a CAN module MCP2515 and their CAN module must be connected between themselves.
